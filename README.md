## Overview 
This Full Stack application is designed to simulate conversation with human users. Chat bots are becoming more popular due to advancements in artificial intelligence and deep learning. Dialogflow is a natural language processing (NLP) API that can be used for building apps people can talk to. After being trained, it can identify user's Intent, extract Entities, and predict what an app should do based on the Context and user query.
